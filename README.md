Welcome to my recreation of the chess game!<br />
<br />
I had a couple of hours of spare time during 2021 holidays so I decided to make this. :D<br />
If you don't know the rules to playing chess, you might wanna inform yourself *via* the help menu (WIP). This project is undone, some of the mate and castling cases are still deficient and the menus are yet to be made.<br />
The visuals are directly taken off chess.com's. The rest of the program was made from scratch using the Pygame library.<br />
<br />
Have fun!<br />
